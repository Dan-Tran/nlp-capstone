These are baselines I made for NLVR!

I noticed that we need to make baselines for our model. These are the baselines that NLVR describes at the end of their paper (RNN and RNN + CNN). They're implemented with AllenNLP (RNN) and Keras (CNN).

Even if we don't end up picking NLVR, the code here is directly related to using vision with AllenNLP, and should be pretty easy to be read / helpful to adapt to whatever use case we need :)
